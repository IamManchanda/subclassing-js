Credits: Learned from [Will Sentance](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/will-sentance/) at [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/object-oriented-js/)

1. Factory Functions (under the hood, with `Object.create` and `Object.setPrototypeOf`)
2. Traditional Way (ES5 and below, with `new` and `call` or `apply`)
3. Modern Way (ES6 and beyond, with `new`, `class`, `extends` and `super`)
